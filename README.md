# JustWrite
> Just the *write* app for You!
## Overview
JustWrite is a secure and feature-rich diary app designed for various Apple platforms. It allows users to create and manage personal diary entries, analyze their mood, and attach multimedia content. The app uses [SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftdata/) for local storage and performs sentiment analysis using on-device AI.

## New Major Changes 🚀
I am proud to announce that the diary entries will now be able to include multimedia content.
1. Diary entries can now include text of three text sizes (h1/h2/h3), images and dividers
2. The images in diary entries are cached to provide smoother experience
## Features ✅
### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility 📱
JustWrite is currently in development to be available with the following operating systems:
- iOS 17.0+
- iPadOS 17.0+
- macOS 14.0+
- tvOS 17.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
### 2. Sentiment Analysis 📊
- JustWrite uses an on-device AI model to analyze the sentiment of diary entries.
- Sentiment scores range from -10 (all negative) to 10 (all positive).
- Users can track mood changes over time, which may aid in early diagnosis of conditions like depression.
### 3. Privacy and Security 🔒
- The AI analysis is performed entirely on the user’s device, ensuring privacy.
- No data is sent to external servers, minimizing privacy concerns.
