# JustWrite
> Just the *write* app for You!
## Overview
JustWrite is a secure and feature-rich diary app designed for various Apple platforms. It allows users to create and manage personal diary entries, analyze their mood, and attach multimedia content. The app uses [SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftdata/) for local storage and performs sentiment analysis using on-device AI.
## Features
### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility
JustWrite is currently in development to be available with the following operating systems:
- iOS 17.0+
- iPadOS 17.0+
- macOS 14.0+
- tvOS 17.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- JustWrite uses an on-device AI model to analyze the sentiment of diary entries.
- Sentiment scores range from -10 (all negative) to 10 (all positive).
- Users can track mood changes over time, which may aid in early diagnosis of conditions like depression.
### 3. Privacy and Security
- The AI analysis is performed entirely on the userâ€™s device, ensuring privacy.
- No data is sent to external servers, minimizing privacy concerns.
### 4. Multimedia Entries
Diary entries can include:
- Text: Write your thoughts, experiences, or reflections.
- Upcoming features (coming soon):
  - Images: Attach photos or screenshots.
  - Audio: Record voice memos.

### 4. Diary entry in View mode
